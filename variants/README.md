This helper generates `Promise` and its variants from the pledge(2) manual pages
hosted at [man.openbsd.org](https://man.openbsd.org). To update the generated
code when thereâ€™s a new OpenBSD release:

    cargo run > ../src/promise.rs

Unlike the library itself, this program is compatible with Rust 1.36.0+ only.
